# Advanced Data Cleaning Techniques with Pandas

Welcome to **Day 14** of the #75DaysChallenge! Today, we focus on **Advanced Data Cleaning Techniques** in Pandas, an essential skill for any data analyst or data scientist. This repository includes a Jupyter Notebook showcasing techniques to handle duplicates, missing values, outliers, and optimize data types for efficient memory usage.

## Project Overview
Data cleaning is crucial to ensure the quality and accuracy of analysis. This notebook covers:
1. **Handling Duplicates** – Identifying and removing duplicate rows.
2. **Managing Missing Values** – Filling missing values conditionally, using interpolation, and forward/backward filling.
3. **Outlier Detection and Handling** – Removing or capping outliers using IQR and Z-score methods.
4. **Optimizing Data Types** – Reducing memory usage by converting data types for large datasets.
